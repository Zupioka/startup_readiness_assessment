CRL,9,Customer Readiness Level 9,"The product/service is widely deployed with repeatable and scalable sales to several customers, often also through partners. There is a large and strongly growing base of active users (strong traction), and the company is heavily focused on business development, customer acquisition, sales growth and building user/customer demand."
CRL,8,Customer Readiness Level 8,"A market-ready product/service is sold to customers at or near the target market price, with a substantial number of active users (initial traction). A formal sales/user acquisition process exists with dedicated people and support systems (e.g. CRM), and agreements with initial partners are in place to reach customers."
CRL,7,Customer Readiness Level 7,"Customer agreements exist for first sales or test sales of early versions, or customers/users are engaged in product/service qualification or extended testing, and there is a small but active user base of these early versions. Discussions with partners to help reach customers/users have been initiated where relevant."
CRL,6,Customer Readiness Level 6,"Customer/user testing has confirmed the value and benefits of the product/service, leading to an updated sales pitch and value proposition based on their feedback. A first sales/user acquisition process is defined, structured sales activities have started, and potential partners or key stakeholders to reach customers/users have been identified."
CRL,5,Customer Readiness Level 5,"Customers/users have clearly expressed interest and confirmed that the product/service can solve their problems/needs, indicating an initial problem–solution fit. Relationships with potential target customers/users provide input, target customer segments have been prioritised, and an initial sales pitch and value proposition tailored to these segments is defined."
CRL,4,Customer Readiness Level 4,"The problem/need and its importance are confirmed by multiple customers or users (typically 5–10 in B2B, 2–5 leading customers in concentrated B2B markets, or around 10–20 in B2C). Basic customer segmentation and profiles exist, the user, paying customer and decision maker are identified, and a product/service hypothesis is positioned clearly against alternatives based on customer/user feedback."
CRL,3,Customer Readiness Level 3,"Primary market research (direct contact with a few potential users/customers or industry/market experts) has provided feedback. There is now a better understanding of possible customers and segments, and the problem/need hypothesis is clearly stated and has been refined using this feedback."
CRL,2,Customer Readiness Level 2,"Some market research has been conducted, mainly from secondary sources, giving brief familiarity with the market, potential customers, their problems/needs and existing alternatives. A first reasonably clear description of the problem/need hypothesis has been formulated."
CRL,1,Customer Readiness Level 1,"You are mainly thinking yourself that a potential need/problem or opportunity might exist in a market, without external validation. There are no clear hypotheses about customers or problems (or they are vague and speculative with no supporting proof or analysis), and knowledge of the market and customers/users is very limited or non-existent."
